abstract = "We evaluated whether fruit selection by autumn-migrating birds at an important stopover site in southern New England was related to water-soluble antioxidant content of fruits. We measured total anthocyanins, total phenolics, and total antioxidant capacity in fruits from common native and non-native plant species and related this to estimates of fruit selection by free-living birds. Birds selected certain fruits over others, with arrowwood (*Viburnum recognitum*, *V. dentatum*) consumed at the highest rate, followed by Virginia creeper (*Parthenocissus quinquefolia*) with much lower consumption of other fruits (e.g., oriental bittersweet [*Celastrus orbiculatus*], multiflora rose [*Rosa multiflora*], winterberry [*Ilex verticillata*]). Antioxidant concentrations primarily differed by shrub species and less so between sites. Arrowwood spp. had the highest total antioxidants, followed by Virginia creeper, northern bayberry (*Myrica pennsylvanica*), chokeberry spp. (*Aronia prunifolia*, *A. melanocarpa*), multiflora rose, winterberry, and oriental bittersweet. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that free-living birds select fruits based, in part, on antioxidant content. We suggest birds may actively select polyphenol/anthocyanin-rich fruits during autumn migration to protect themselves against the potentially damaging effects of oxidative stress caused by long-distance fasting flight."
